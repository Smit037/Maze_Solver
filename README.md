Description - This project uses the Wall Follower algorithm to solve a Simply Connected Maze on a Gazebo environment using Robot Operating System (ROS). 
Algorithm - The Wall Follower algorithm follows a particular wall (right or left) until it reaches the end of the maze. 
Environment - Launch the teleop.launch file using the roslaunch function and build the maze using building model editor. 
Code - Develop a node which subscribes values from laser/scan node and publishes the velocities to the nodes of the wheels.
